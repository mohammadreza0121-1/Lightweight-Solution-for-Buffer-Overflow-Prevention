# LsStk: Lightweight Solution for Buffer Overflow Prevention

## üìò Overview
**LsStk** is a project focused on preventing buffer overflow vulnerabilities using a lightweight encryption-based solution. Buffer overflow attacks are a common security threat, especially in embedded and IoT devices with limited resources. The **LsStk** algorithm aims to secure function return addresses against exploitation while maintaining a low computational footprint, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments.

## üîç Key Features
- **Encryption-Based Protection**: Uses a lightweight encryption algorithm to protect return addresses in the stack.
- **Statistical Analysis of Attack Models**: Simulates and evaluates various attack scenarios, including:
  - Trial and Test Attack
  - Byte-for-Byte Attack on XOR and LsStk Encryption
  - Brute Force Attack
- **CDF Analysis**: Provides Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots to demonstrate the probability of attack success under different conditions.

## üìà Visualizations

### 1. Trial and Test Attack
This plot shows the CDF for the Trial and Test attack, highlighting the probability of successful exploitation across a range of attempts.

### 3. Brute Force Attack
This CDF plot illustrates the probability of success for a brute force attack, showing a linear increase in success probability as the number of attempts grows.
